#  **Mystic Memory Game**

### *A UI Experiment Powered by Curiosity, LLM Exploration & Practical Problem-Solving*

##  **Overview**

**Mystic Memory Game** started as a simple experiment while I was exploring **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and how they can support non-native developers in building quick, interactive product prototypes.
I’m not originally from a deep front-end background — but with LLM-assisted workflows, I was able to design, refine, and ship a clean, functional, and responsive memory-matching game.

Why does this matter?
Because in real teams — whether product, branding, or marketing — there’s always a need for **fast, polished interactive UI pieces** to test ideas, demonstrate concepts, or engage users. LLMs make this process dramatically simpler, faster, and more collaborative.

This game demonstrates exactly that.

It’s a compact, memory game where users flip mystical cards, match pairs, and race against the clock — the same type of activity used in many **recruitment Online Assessment (OA) rounds** to test attention, pattern recognition, and cognitive agility.
I built it to understand how LLMs can assist recruiters and branding teams in building interactive evaluators for candidate testing and product engagement.


##  **Key Features**

*  **16-card memory grid** (8 mystical symbol pairs)
*  **Live timer** tracking performance
*  **Move counter** for accuracy scoring
*  **Win modal** for final stats
*  Restart & play-again buttons
*  Fully responsive, mobile-friendly
*  Smooth, clean flip animations


##  **Tech Stack**

* **HTML5** – Layout & structure
* **CSS3** – Styling, animations, responsive grid
* **JavaScript** – Core logic, event handling, game engine

This project intentionally avoids heavy frameworks — showing how LLM-assisted coding can help build fast, lightweight systems from scratch.


##  **Behind the Logic**

The game follows a simple, recruiter-style memory evaluation flow:

1. Cards shuffle on each play.
2. Each card hides a mystical icon.
3. Users flip two → system checks for match.
4. Matches stay; mismatches flip back with a delay.
5. Timer + move counter update continuously.
6. When all pairs are found → the results modal appears.


This project shows how **LLMs can bridge that gap**:

* Rapid UI prototyping
* Instant design updates
* Easy theme customization
* Faster iteration cycles

Even if front-end isn’t your core skill — LLMs let you create high-quality prototypes that marketing can test, designers can iterate on, and recruiters can use for evaluation tasks.


##  **Future Enhancements**

*  Sound FX & thematic audio
*  Scoreboard / global leaderboard
*  Difficulty modes (4×4, 6×6, 8×8)
*  Animated backgrounds
